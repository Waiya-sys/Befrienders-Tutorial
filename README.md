## Introduction

The <span style="color: blue;">**Befrienders Excel Dashboard**</span> offers a powerful tool for tracking engagement, analyzing data, and visualizing trends. It comprises three essential components: the **Dashboard**, **Data Sheet**, and **Form**.

## Prerequisites

   - On the File tab, go to Options > Customize Ribbon.

## Dashboard Overview

The Dashboard provides a comprehensive visual overview of engagement data. It automatically updates based on information entered in the Data Sheet.

## Entering Engagement Information

   - **Bereavement Status**, **Past Psychiatrist History**.
3. Click "**Save**" to record the engagement.

## Refreshing Data.

1. Refresh Pivot Tables:
 -Pivot tables in Excel are dynamic, meaning they automatically adjust to changes in the source data. However, you often need to refresh them manually to reflect the latest data.
 -Select any cell within a pivot table.
 -Go to the "PivotTable Tools" or "Analyzing" tab in the Excel ribbon.
 -Click on the "Refresh" button. This will update all pivot tables in the workbook to reflect changes in the source data.
2. Automatic Refresh:
 -If you want your pivot tables to update automatically whenever changes are made to the source data, you can set the refresh options.

 -Right-click on a pivot table and select "PivotTable Options."
 -Under the "Data" tab, select "Refresh data when opening the file" and "Refresh this data when opening the file."
 -This way, the pivot tables will be updated whenever you open the file.
## Data Analysis and Visualization

1. Engagements are recorded in the "Data Sheet," containing 14 columns for each field.
2. The **Data Sheet** acts as a repository of all engagement records.
3. <span style="color: orange;">**Avoid modifying the Data Sheet structure**</span> to ensure proper functionality.

2. Utilize filters on the far-left to refine data analysis by:
